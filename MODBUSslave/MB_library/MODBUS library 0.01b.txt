-> Serial instance name change to ModSerial which define explicitly in the main code 
   e.g ModSerial Serial, ModSerial Serial1, ModSerial Serial2

-> edit external epprom functionality in set function of ModbusRegBank.c file 

-> modbusslave library is not using instead embedded into main code (bug faced Serial shifting )
